# The Heilmeier Catechism

*Developed by George H. Heilmeier, former DARPA Director (1975-1977)*

Use these eight questions to evaluate any technical proposal. If you can't answer them clearly, you're not ready to write the one-pager.

## The Questions

### 1. What are you trying to do?
Articulate your objectives using **absolutely no jargon**.

> *Test: Can your grandmother understand it? Can a smart person outside your team understand it?*

---

### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Describe the status quo honestly. What works? What doesn't? Why are existing solutions inadequate?

> *Test: Have you actually investigated alternatives, or are you assuming your approach is better?*

---

### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
Explain what's different about your proposal. Why will it work where others have failed?

> *Test: Is there genuine novelty, or are you reinventing the wheel? What evidence supports your confidence?*

---

### 4. Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?
Identify stakeholders and quantify impact. Why should anyone invest time or resources in this?

> *Test: Can you name specific people or teams who will benefit? Can you put numbers on the improvement?*

---

### 5. What are the risks?
Be honest about what could go wrong. Technical risks, organizational risks, execution risks.

> *Test: If you say "risks are minimal," you haven't thought hard enough. Every project has risks.*

---

### 6. How much will it cost?
Include time, money, people, and opportunity cost (what won't get done if you do this).

> *Test: Is your estimate realistic, or optimistic? What are you basing it on?*

---

### 7. How long will it take?
Provide a timeline with phases and milestones. Be realistic, not aspirational.

> *Test: What similar work have you done? How long did that take? Why will this be different?*

---

### 8. What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success?
Define measurable criteria. How will you know if you're on track? How will you know when you're done?

> *Test: Are these actually measurable? Would two people agree on whether the criterion was met?*

## Using the Catechism

### Before You Start Writing
Run through all eight questions verbally. If you struggle to answer any of them, that's where you need to do more thinking or research.

### During the Interview Process
Use these questions as your guide. Each phase of the interview maps to one or more questions.

### For Self-Review
Before sharing your one-pager, verify that every question is answered clearly in the document.

### For Critique
Score each question: **Strong | Adequate | Weak | Missing**

A one-pager with any "Missing" scores is not ready for review.

## Common Failures

| Question | Common Failure | Better Approach |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Q1 | Too much jargon | Explain like I'm five |
| Q2 | Strawman alternatives | Steel-man the competition |
| Q3 | "Best practice" justification | Explain the specific mechanism |
| Q4 | Vague benefits | Quantified impact with numbers |
| Q5 | "Risks are minimal" | Honest risk assessment with mitigations |
| Q6 | Optimistic estimates | Evidence-based estimates with padding |
| Q7 | No milestones | Phased timeline with checkpoints |
| Q8 | Unmeasurable criteria | Specific, observable outcomes |

## The Meta-Question

After answering all eight, ask yourself:

> **"If I were the decision-maker, would this document give me everything I need to say yes or no?"**

If not, what's missing?

## Origin Story

George Heilmeier developed these questions while leading DARPA, where researchers were proposing ambitious, expensive, high-risk projects. He needed a way to quickly assess whether proposals were well-thought-out or half-baked.

The catechism forces clarity. You cannot hide behind jargon, optimism, or vagueness when you must answer these eight questions directly.

The same discipline that helps evaluate a billion-dollar defense research program helps evaluate a two-week engineering project. The scale changes; the thinking required does not.
