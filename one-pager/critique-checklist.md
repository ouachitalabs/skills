## Structure & Completeness

### TL;DR Section

### Alternatives
- [ ] At least 2-3 alternatives considered
- [ ] Alternatives are real options (not strawmen)
- [ ] Clear reasons for rejection
- [ ] "Do nothing" is addressed

### Risks
- [ ] Technical risks identified
- [ ] Organizational risks identified
- [ ] Risks are honest (not dismissed)
- [ ] Mitigations provided for major risks

### Cost & Timeline
- [ ] Effort is estimated (engineer-weeks, not just "a few weeks")

- [ ] Timeline has phases/milestones
- [ ] Estimates seem realistic

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Midterm checkpoints defined
- [ ] Final success criteria defined
- [ ] Criteria are measurable (specific numbers)

## Writing Quality

### Clarity
- [ ] Can someone outside the team understand it?

- [ ] Actually fits on one page (single-spaced, reasonable margins)

### Conviction
- [ ] Recommendation stated with confidence

- [ ] No hedging: "some users," "many teams," "significant impact"
- [ ] Specific where specificity is possible

### Evidence
- [ ] Claims are supported by data
- [ ] Sources for data are credible
- [ ] Numbers are precise, not vague
- [ ] Anecdotes are supplementary, not primary evidence

## Red Flags

Check for these common problems:

### Solution-First Thinking
- [ ] ❌ Document leads with technology/approach before explaining problem
- [ ] ❌ Problem statement feels reverse-engineered from the solution

### Strawman Alternatives  
- [ ] ❌ Alternatives are obviously inferior
- [ ] ❌ No explanation of when alternatives WOULD be right

### False Precision
- [ ] ❌ Specific numbers without sources
- [ ] ❌ Estimates to false precision (e.g., "23.7% improvement")

### Optimism Bias
- [ ] ❌ Timeline seems too short for scope
- [ ] ❌ "Risks are minimal" or similar dismissal
- [ ] ❌ No mention of what could go wrong

### Missing Stakeholder Awareness
- [ ] ❌ No mention of who needs to approve
- [ ] ❌ No mention of who will be impacted
- [ ] ❌ No mention of dependencies on other teams

### Vague Impact
- [ ] ❌ Benefits described without quantification
- [ ] ❌ "Improved developer experience" without metrics
- [ ] ❌ "Better performance" without numbers

## Summary Assessment

### Overall Readiness

- [ ] **Ready for Review**: All sections complete, no red flags
- [ ] **Needs Minor Revision**: 1-2 weak sections, easy fixes
- [ ] **Needs Major Revision**: Multiple weak/missing sections
- [ ] **Not Ready**: Fundamental gaps, needs more research/thinking

### Top 3 Issues

1. [Most critical issue]
2. [Second issue]
3. [Third issue]

### Recommended Actions

1. [Specific action to address issue 1]
2. [Specific action to address issue 2]
3. [Specific action to address issue 3]

## Questions for the Author

Use these to guide a follow-up interview if needed:

**If problem is weak:**
- "Can you give me a specific recent example of this pain?"
- "What data do we have that shows this is a real problem?"
- "Who complained about this? When? How often?"

**If alternatives are weak:**
- "What would have to be true for [Alternative X] to be the right choice?"
- "Did you talk to anyone who prefers a different approach? What did they say?"
- "Why hasn't someone solved this already?"

**If risks are dismissed:**
- "What's the worst case scenario if this fails?"
- "What's the most likely thing to go wrong?"
- "Have you done something similar before? What surprised you?"

**If success criteria are vague:**
- "What metric would move if this succeeds?"
- "How much would it need to move for you to call this a success?"
- "How will you know in 6 months if this was worth it?"

**If ask is unclear:**
- "What specifically do you need from me/us?"
- "What happens if we say no?"
- "What happens if we say yes but delay by a month?"
