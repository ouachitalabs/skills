# [TITLE]: [Value Proposition Subtitle]

**Author:** [Name]  
**Date:** [Date]  
**Status:** Draft | Review | Final  
**Reviewers:** [List names]

## TL;DR

[2-3 sentences maximum. State the problem, your recommendation, and what you're asking for. If someone reads nothing else, they should understand your pitch from this section alone.]

---

## The Problem

[1-2 paragraphs. Describe the current state and why it's inadequate. Be specific and quantify the pain. Include data: metrics, costs, time wasted, error rates, user complaints. Answer: "Why should anyone care about this?" and "Why now?"]

---

## Proposed Solution

[1-2 paragraphs. Describe your approach at a high level. Explain WHY this will work, not just WHAT you'll build. Connect the solution directly to the problem. Save implementation details for the appendix or a follow-up RFC.]

---

## Alternatives Considered

**[Alternative 1]:** [1-2 sentences on what it is and why rejected]

**[Alternative 2]:** [1-2 sentences on what it is and why rejected]

**Do Nothing:** [What happens if we don't act? Why is that unacceptable?]

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | [L/M/H] | [L/M/H] | [How you'll address it] |
| [Risk 2] | [L/M/H] | [L/M/H] | [How you'll address it] |

---

## Cost & Timeline

**Effort:** [X engineer-weeks]  
**Resources:** [People, infrastructure, budget needed]  
**Opportunity Cost:** [What won't get done if we do this]

| Phase | Duration | Milestone |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| [Phase 1] | [X weeks] | [What's delivered] |
| [Phase 2] | [X weeks] | [What's delivered] |

---

## Success Criteria

**Midterm (Week X):** [Measurable checkpoint]

**Final (Week Y):** [Measurable outcome - specific numbers]

**Evaluation Period:** [How long after launch until we assess success]

---

## The Ask

[Be explicit. What decision do you need? What action should the reader take? Examples:]
- [ ] Approve this approach and allocate [X] engineers for [Y] weeks
- [ ] Provide feedback by [date] so we can begin Phase 1 on [date]
- [ ] Greenlight a proof-of-concept to validate assumption [X]
